# Exploring the Depths

###### 19th April, 2025

We were pressed for time. With only two nights in Cherrapunji, it was now our last day. We had to make a decision: [the bamboo trek](https://g.co/kgs/hJPMkmd) or the cave?

I remember us returning from [Nongriat](https://g.co/kgs/XeP7Tmv), struggling with this exact dilemma. I dropped a poll in the group chat. The boys had voted, but to no consensus. It was three for three. I was left. I bit the bullet—put myself down for the latter. The other three, including GS, decided to sit this one out. It was settled. The rest of us would be heading to the cave tomorrow.

### Doomsday

We decided to leave at nine, and nine it was. The driver—late as usual (but otherwise a pretty chill guy, so I won't go off on a tirade about it). We had to leave for Shnongpdeng after the cave, making it imperative that we got back early. It was winter, and the sun, as we previously learned, would set before five. GS drilled this into us—making us promise to be out by one, threatening to leave us if we weren’t.

It was past ten when we reached the office at the village. We met two guides here who briefed us on the expedition and would lead us through it. They handed us serious-looking jumpsuits equipped with knee and elbow guards, helmets fitted with headlamps, and gumboots for our feet. _Surely,_ I thought to myself, _all of this must be overkill_.

Meghalaya is home to a vast number of caves. Some of these are popular tourist spots due to their ease of access and navigability. Where we were going, however, was considered a bit more advanced and did not attract as many visitors. According to our guides, the four of us, along with the two of them, were the only ones to venture inside that day.

The journey from the office to the cave entrance constituted a forty-minute hike. The gumboots weren't exactly cushioned, and our feet were still mourning yesterday's twenty-five-thousand-step trek. Suffice it to say, this wasn't the most comfortable journey. The discomfort, however, was compensated for by the stunning scenery. After walking on a paved road for a few minutes, we scaled a small hill that curved around a huge limestone quarry. Along the way, we passed an abandoned cement factory—massive, but eerily silent. Then we entered a forested area and followed a ten-minute trail to reach the entrance.

We were finally here. Mawmluh Cave.

### A Cave Through Time

Stretching over seven kilometers, Mawmluh is the fourth-longest cave in the Indian subcontinent. We planned to traverse about four kilometers of it—the rest, we were told, is highly dangerous and closed off to inexperienced visitors.

Carved out slowly by water over millions of years, Mawmluh's limestone and dolomite walls bear immense geological significance. In fact, they hold a [stalagmite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalagmite) deposit that serves as the global reference point ([GSSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Boundary_Stratotype_Section_and_Point)) for the start of the Meghalayan Age—the most recent stage of the [geologic epoch that we live in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene). This deposit contains distinct chemical signatures of a [4,200-year-old climate event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4.2-kiloyear_event), which triggered a sharp decline in global monsoon rainfall.

From the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghalayan) on the Meghalayan Age:

> In respect of the Mawmluh Cave site being the "GSSP of the youngest unit of the geologic time scale associated with dramatic climate changes with implications on human civilisation" the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) included the GSSP of the Meghalayan Stage in the Mawmluh Cave in its assemblage of 100 "geological heritage sites" around the world in a listing published in October 2022.

I won’t delve further into this, but I recommend that you do—it is an [extremely fascinating read](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-44868527).

### The Depths

The entrance to the cave was so narrow that I could barely squeeze through. Individuals with even slightly larger dimensions would have a tough time. Once inside, the terrain quickly began shifting, bearing less and less resemblance to the outside world. Strange rock formations jutted out, and crevices of indiscernible depth lay beneath us. There were puddles of water scattered everywhere. The guides helped us navigate, showing us where to place our hands and feet. It reminded me of a sport I had recently taken up—[bouldering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouldering).

A few minutes in, the cave became utterly devoid of external light. We turned off our headlamps to experience the darkness firsthand. The phrase _pitch black_ had never been more apt. It is important to note that most of us rarely experience absolute darkness. There is always some trace of light, however faint. But here, opening my eyes felt no different from keeping them shut.

With every step deeper, things became more surreal. We threaded our way through tight squeezes as well as vast halls, encountering magnificent rock formations all along the way. These formations, known as [speleothems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speleothem), are shaped by the slow deposition of minerals from dripping water, typically growing at a rate of 0.1 to 1 mm per year. This means that a [stalactite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalactite) as tall as me would take anywhere from 1,800 to **18,000 years** to form—and there were plenty even taller. Most of these formations were shimmering because of moisture and crystalline minerals like calcite, which reflect and refract light. In some cases, this even led to a subtle rainbow-like effect.

There were streams, waterfalls, and even whole-ass pools inside the cave. One such pool blocked our path, forcing us to wade through. The water was frigid, rising past our waists even as we clung to the edges. The guides carried a waterproof duffel bag, allowing us to keep our electronics safe. On the other side, however, our gumboots were flooded, and we spent a good ten minutes trying to drain them.

Eventually, we arrived at an expansive chamber covered in speleothems. Some of the stalactites here had merged with their corresponding stalagmites, giving rise to what is known as columns (or [pillars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalactite#Pillars)). This fantastical place was called the _Queen's Chamber_. I’m not sure why, though. I'd like to think it was because the formations here resembled the grand chandeliers of a royal palace—ornate, towering, and frozen in time. Whatever the reason, one thing was certain—it was unlike anything I had ever seen before.

After exploring the Queen's Chamber for a while, we started backtracking. We passed a familiar junction and were once again on an untrodden path. Before long, we arrived at a dead end—or so we thought. The guides sat down and gave us [Fuse bars](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuse_(chocolate_bar)>)—it was break time. Following our short respite, they asked us to hand over our electronics and solemnly looked at the ground. In front of us was a tunnel—barely three feet in height. Now, by no means would I recommend spelunking to a claustrophobe, but this was daunting even to the rest of us.

And so, get on all fours we did. The end not in sight, we began crawling. The terrain was a mix of jagged rock and water-filled craters. Crawling through a three-foot tunnel with _jagged rock and water-filled craters_ is exactly as fun as it sounds. I remember thinking how the guards on my jumpsuit were the only things keeping me from busting my knee.

After about fifteen minutes of this, we were finally back on our feet. The topography had changed again, and we found ourselves surrounded by slimy puddles of water lined with [moonmilk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonmilk)—a white, creamy, cheese-like speleothem. It was unsettling yet beautiful—like something out of an alien world.

Soon enough, we came across a massive opening in the cave’s roof, letting in a shaft of light. We weren't far from the exit now.

### Life in the Darkness

Throughout our journey, I failed to spot any signs of flora—except for a tiny plant with two leaves, which felt like a poetic representation of life defying desolation.

As for fauna, I saw a few spiders the size of my palm, some white _shrimp_ (they looked more like lobsters, but the guides called them shrimp), and a few tiny, white insects. Many cave-dwelling species, known as [troglobites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_troglobites), are white due to living in total darkness, where pigmentation offers no advantage. Some have even evolved over generations to lose their eyes.

I also spotted a bat. The guide mentioned that one of the forbidden sections housed a chamber—the _Bat Chamber_—teeming with them. Bryan saw crabs as well, but decided not to tell me (despite knowing what a fiend I am for wildlife). But that’s okay; I try not to hold grudges.

### Echoes from the Depths

I made the—perhaps foolish—decision of carrying my camera inside. I say this because there were sections of the cave where we were up till our waists in water, sections where we had to crawl—sometimes through puddles, and sections where we had to be careful not to fall into the abyss. I hit my head on top like three times, and if not for the helmet, I would've surely broken it. Luckily, I did manage to bring my camera back in one piece. But turns out, _all of this was not overkill_.

I remember when Minecraft put out their [Caves & Cliffs update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdrn4ouZRvQ). Caves had always been an integral part of the game, but this update made them more expansive, even introducing new types. We hadn't played it in ages, but the boys and I just happened to hop on around that time. I always found the exploration of these biomes and the adventure surrounding them fascinating, but funnily enough, I never really thought of it beyond the game. Visiting Mawmluh reminded me that these places are real. And they're incredible.

It was past three when we finally emerged. As you would imagine, we weren't able to make it to Shnongpdeng by sunset. Then again, pulling that off was never really on the table...
