# Going Raw

###### 16th August, 2025

Couple weeks back, while on a date, I was walking down some stairs when I missed a step and sprained my foot. She lost interest because of my zodiac, and my foot still hurts. I took this as a sign from the universe to get off both Hinge and alcohol, and decided to do what one normally does after such an experienceâ€”focus on themselves.

I've been dancing around the idea of 12% body fat for quite a while now but have never actually put in the effort to make it happen. Having weight-liftedâ€”albeit on-and-off and generally unfocusedâ€”for over five years, I don't think my physique justifies it. The lowest I've gotten to is 14~ (according to my watch which is supposed to be fairly accurate). But this, again, was mostly because I fell really sick back then.

At the time of writing this, Iâ€™m sitting around 17%. The goal? Get to 12 by Novemberâ€”three months from now. For the record, this isnâ€™t an easy feat to accomplish. The leaner you get, the harder your body fights to hold onto fat. Statistically, only about 0.1â€“0.5% of men ever get thereâ€”a probability as slim as becoming a millionaire (maybe slimmer). In any case, I'm writing this post to hold myself accountable and to ensure that I come through. If you see me in November, and Iâ€™m not fucking shredded, I ask that you donâ€™t let me off the hook.

### The Plan

Never had I meal-prepped or counted calories before, but these are things that had to be done. Being a generally very gluttonous individual that will eat just about anything that comes his way, this sort of restriction does come as a bit of a bummer. Given my dimensions, distribution of substance, and approximate measure of activity, I'm compelled to start at no more than 2300kcal a dayâ€”a 700~kcal [deficit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caloric_deficit). Anything below this, I risk losing muscle; anything above, and I stray farther from my goal. To preserve muscle mass, I also need to ensure that I round up over 165 grams of protein each day. The rest of the calories may come in whatever proportion from fats and carbs. Anything too restrictive would compromise on flexibility and sustainability.

> If you're completely new to dieting and nutrition, but for some reason are still reading this, it may help to know that every calorie that you consume comes from one of the three components of food that the body needs to provide energy and support functioningâ€”carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Together, they're called macronutrients (or macros, for short). One gram of fat provides 9 calories, whereas one gram of protein or carbohydrates provides 4. This essentially means that your dietâ€”no matter what you eatâ€”is the amalgamtion of these three components i.e. `x` grams of carbs + `y` grams of protein + `z` grams of fat.

I've been intermittent fasting for several years now and will be continuing to do so. People who tell you that breakfast is the most important meal of the day have no idea what they're talking about. I split my calorie intake into three meals spanning a course of eight hours. Ideally, you'd want to spread your protein intake out as much as possible. Your body can only use so much protein at a time to build/repair muscleâ€”a phenomenon known as muscle protein synthesis (MPS). That said, if total daily protein is hit, youâ€™ll still make progress. Spreading just makes it a bit more _optimal_.

For my first and last meal, that I try to have at 1200 and 2000 hours respectively, I grill some chicken and have it with a side of carbs. For carbs, I normally have quinoa or brown rice with a generous serving of vegetables. Quinoa might just be the single healthiest grain (botanically a _pseudograin_, but nutritionally grouped with grains) in the world. It contains all 9 essential amino acids, making it a complete protein, which is rare for plant foods. It's also rich in minerals and really high in fiber. I also like having brown riceâ€”mainly because I can make fried rice with it, which tastes quite good and, in my opinion, even better than quinoa. In fact, you know what? Fuck it, I'm going to write out my fried rice recipe now.

### The Plan

In a cast-iron skillet (anything else is a compromise), spray (or pour and spread) a touch of olive oil on medium-high heat. Empty 150 grams of your choice of finely chopped vegetables into this. I normally default to some combination of 4-5 vegetables from spinach, carrot, capsicum, broccoli, mushroom, beans, cauliflower, corn, and peas. Add 2 tablespoons of ginger garlic paste and stir fry this for about 3-4 minutes.

Once your vegetables have cooked for a while and have taken up some colour, add 150 grams of cooked rice into the mix. I prefer brown rice to white because of its higher protein, fiber, and satiety. Rice typically triples in weight on cookingâ€”so to yield 150 grams of cooked rice, you would need 50 grams of uncooked. Also, fried rice tastes better with _leftover_ rice, so cooking and storing it in the fridge a day or two before consumption is likely to enhance its textural consistency and give it that _al dente_ feel.

Move the contents of your pan to occupy only half of its space. Add a touch of oil and crack an egg into the other half. Stir the egg for a minute and then mix it with the rest of the contents. This allows the egg to coat the rice elevating its _fried rice taste_. Next, add in your sauces. I add about 20 grams of soya sauce with a little bit of gochujang or chili-garlic. Stir for some time and then add salt to taste.

You can either add in the chicken directly to the rice or have it separately. In both cases I use about 160 grams of uncooked chicken, which yields about 125 grams of cooked. If you're adding it to the rice you would want to dice it into small pieces and stir fry it for a minute or two beforehand. Chicken breastâ€”which is what you should be usingâ€”gets overcooked and chewy very easily (especially when cut into small pieces); so it is imperative not to cook it for long. Even though it may be slightly undercooked after your initial round of stir frying it will be properly done after you pour it back into the pan. Do this before adding in your sauces.

I personally prefer cooking my chicken separately. For this, you want to take the entire breast and pound it with a mallet or a rolling pin to flatten it out (I have neither so I use the flat end of a beer glass). If the breast is still thicker than 1-1.5cm, you want to slice it across the grain into thinner strips. Marinate this with salt, pepper, chili powder, and ginger garlic paste, and keep it to dry under a fan or something because moisture can mess up consistency. Once done, whip out the good ol' skillet, and hit it with a touch of oil on medium-high heat. Lay the strips onto the pan, but don't crowd it. Cook for 3-4 minutes on both sides. Slap some 15 grams of gochujang onto those bad boys, and cook it for like a minute. You're now done: grilled chickenâ€”tender to the biteâ€”ready for consumption. Place this next to the rice and your meal is ready.

Here are the macros for this meal based on the specific ingredients that I use:

| ------------------------- | ----------- | --------- | ------- | --------------- |

| **Total**                 | **53**      | **69**    | **17**  | **661**         |

Wait, where was Iâ€”

### The Plan

Two meals of the aforementioned recipe weigh in at 1400-1500kcal, depending on my choice of grain, vegetables, and sauce. That leaves me with 800kcal which I use up in âœ¨Meal 2âœ¨ for which I make an elaborate protein shake. I'm going to spare you the in-depth macro split for this, but it amounts to 65 grams of protein, and consists of whey (obviously), peanut butter (currently having [Pintola's High Protein Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter](https://pintola.in/collections/high-protein-peanut-butter/products/high-protein-dark-chocolate-peanut-butter), and it's to DIE for), chia seeds (I don't really like chia seeds but people keep telling me it's healthy), a banana (for that quick-release energy), almonds (because I'm dulling with age), and creatine ('cuz ðŸ’ª). Optionally, I'll also add a li'l bit of muesli (if I can afford the calories), honey (if the protein's not flavoured), coffee (if it's pre-1600 hours), and cinnamon powder (if I'm feeling fancy).

Another thing I want to talk aboutâ€”because it's my websiteâ€”is peanut butter. I absolutely love it, and I have three jars at home: one regular Sundrop Crunchy, one Pintola (the one I mentioned earlier), and one _powdered peanut butter_ (yes, thatâ€™s a thing) from [MYPB](https://mypb.co.in/). If I was a serious person, I would've probably just had a single jar of [Pintola's Unsweetened](https://pintola.in/products/high-protein-all-natural-peanut-butter-unsweetened). The thing about peanut butter is that it's very easy to go overboard. One must possess a certain degree of willpower to include it in their diet without deleterious effects. Powdered peanut butter can be a good alternative for others. Since it's made by pressing out the oils from roasted peanuts, it is significantly lower in calories, whilst also being higher in protein. It is, however, more expensive. I usually prefer regular peanut butter because I need the fats to [help absorb them vitamins](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/fat-soluble-vitamins). Oh, speaking of vitaminsâ€”I take supplements for those along with my shake.

Now that I'm done talking about peanut butter, I'm going to start talking about cheating. Going raw certainly has its advantages, but it's important to pull out at the right time. On Saturdays, after fasting all day, I devour up to 2500kcal (slightly below my caloric maintainence) of my favourite foods (_\*cough\*_ triple smash burger) in one sitting. This hedonistic deviation has become the most ritualistically followed practice I've adopted since I stopped going to church. Cheat meals can play an integral role in cutting. Apart from helping you maintain a semblance of sanity, they can also aid with fat loss and physical performance. Healthline has a [great article](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/refeed-day) elucidating the potential benefits of what is known as a _refeed day_.

Apart from this, yeah, I usually hit the gym five times a week for 1.5-2 hours and aim for 10,000 steps everyday. When you start cutting, you tend to encounter a dearth of energy intensified by the recurrent hunger pang, but it is important to try to continue lifting as much as before. The energy situation can be addressed to a considerable degree by timing your carbs, and getting adequate, good quality sleep. Dropping your weights, on the other hand, can induce strength loss.

### The Wait

Reading this back, it feels as if Iâ€™ve already arrived at the physique Iâ€™m still working toward. I'm going to pause here and revisit in November once I see how it all plays out.

The rest is in Godâ„¢'s hands.
