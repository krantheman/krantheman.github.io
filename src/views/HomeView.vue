			<h1 class="sm:mt-0">Hi, I'm Akash</h1>
			<p>I like programming and travellingâ€”sometimes together!</p>
			<p>
				I work as a software developer at an
				<a href="https://frappe.io/" target="_blank">awesome company</a>, where
				I'm currently building an
				<a href="https://github.com/frappe/mail" target="_blank">
					open-source email client</a
				>.
			</p>
			<p>
				I made this website primarily out of my disdain for Instagram and how it
				handled
				<router-link to="/gallery">my images</router-link>. I figured I could
				also use it for <router-link to="/blog">writing stuff</router-link> now
				and then. This is <i>not</i> a portfolio, but I've listed some of
				<router-link to="/projects">my projects</router-link>
				as well.

			<p>
				You can find links to all my socials in the navbar. Feel free to reach
				out for anything!
